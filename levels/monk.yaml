      Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield,
      your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.
  - name: Martial Arts
    description: |-
      At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of
      combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons,
      which are short-swords and any simple melee weapons that don't have
      the two-handed or heavy property.


      You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding
      only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:

       - You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage
      rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.

       - You can roll you martial arts die in place of the normal damage of
      your unarmed strike or monk weapon.

       - When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon
      on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
  - name: Dedicated Weapon
    description: |-
      Also at 2nd level, you train yourself to use a variety of weapons as monk weapons,
      not just simple melee weapons and short-swords.
      Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can touch one weapon, focus your ki on it,
      and then count that weapon as a monk weapon until you use this feature again.

      The chosen weapon must meet these criteria:
      
        - The weapon must be a simple or martial weapon.
      
        - You must be proficient with it.
      
        - It must lack the heavy and special properties.

  - name: Ki
    description: |-
      Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki.
      Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points.
      Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the
      Ki Points column of the Monk table.

      You can spend these points to fuel various ki features.
      You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense,
      and Step of the Wind.
      You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

      When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short
      or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back
      into yourself.
      You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.

      Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to
      resist the feature's effects.

      At 3rd level, your mystical touch can mend wounds.
      As an action, you can spend 1 ki point to touch a creature and restore a
      number of hit points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your
      Wisdom modifier.

      When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the
      unarmed strikes with a use of this feature without spending a ki point for the healing.

      When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike,

    description: |-
      Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the
      missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack.
      When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by
      1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

      If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small
      enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.
      If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a
      ranged attack with a range of 20/60 using the weapon or piece of
      ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.
      You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon
      proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

      Also at 3rd level, if you spend 1 ki point or more as part of your action on your turn,

      action before the end of the turn.
