  Monks use rigorous combat training and mental discipline to align themselves with the
  multiverse and tap into internal reservoirs of power. Different Monks conceptualize this
  power in various ways: as breath, energy, life force, essence, or self, for example. Whether
  channeled as a striking display of martial prowess or as a subtler focus of defense and
  speed, this power infuses all that a Monk does.
  
  Monks harness and focus their internal power to create extraordinary, even supernatural,
  effects. They channel uncanny speed and strength into their attacks, with or without the
  use of weapons. In a Monk’s hands, even the most basic weapons can become sophisticated
  implements of combat mastery. A Monk’s mightiest attacks can stun their opponents.
  
  Many Monks find that a structured life of ascetic withdrawal from the mundane world
  helps them cultivate the physical and mental discipline they need to harness their power.
  Other Monks believe that immersing themselves in the vibrant confusion of life helps to fuel their
  determination and discipline.
  
  Monks generally view their adventures as personal tests of their physical and mental
  development. They are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely
  slaying monsters and plundering treasure; they strive to hone themselves into living weapons.

      Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your Unarmed Strike
      and Monk Weapons, which are Simple Melee Weapons and Martial Weapons with the Light
      property.
      
      You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Monk Weapons and
      you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a Shield:

      - Bonus Unarmed Strike: You can make one Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action.
      
      - Dexterous Attacks: You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage
        rolls of your Unarmed Strikes and Monk Weapons. In addition, when you choose the
        Grapple or Shove option, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of Strength to
        determine the saving throw DC.

      - Martial Arts Die. You can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your Unarmed Strike or
        Monk Weapons.

      Your self-discipline and martial training allow you to harness a well of extraordinary energy
      within yourself. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of Discipline Points.
      Your Monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Discipline
      Points column of the Monk table.
      
      You can spend these points to fuel certain Monk features. You start knowing three such
      features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed
      below.
      
      When you spend a Discipline Point, it is unavailable until you finish a Short Rest or Long
      Rest, at the end of which you regain all your expended points.
      
      Some features that use Discipline Points require your target to make a saving throw. The
      saving throw DC equals 8 plus your Proficiency Bonus plus your Wisdom modifier.

  Monks of the Way of Mercy learn to manipulate the life force of others to bring
  aid to those in need. They are wandering physicians to the poor and hurt.
  However, to those beyond their help, they bring a swift end as an act of mercy.
  
  Those who follow the Way of Mercy might be members of a religious order,
  administering to the needy and making grim choices rooted in reality rather than idealism.
  Some might be gentle-voiced healers, beloved by their communities,
  while others might be masked bringers of macabre mercies.
  
  The walkers of this way usually don robes with deep cowls, and they often conceal
  their faces with masks, presenting themselves as the faceless bringers of life and death.
