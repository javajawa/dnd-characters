      Your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use your Unarmed Strike
      and Simple Weapons.
      
      You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only Simple Weapons and 
      you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:

       - You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage 
         rolls of your Unarmed Strikes and Simple Weapons, except those that
         have the TwoHanded property.

       - You can roll you martial arts die in place of the normal damage of
         your unarmed strike.

       - When you use the Attack action with an Unarmed Strike or a 
         Simple Weapon on your turn, you can make one Unarmed Strike as a Bonus Action on the 
         same turn.
  - name: Weapon Mastery
    description: >-
      Your training with weapons allows you to use the Mastery property of two kinds of Simple 
      weapons of your choice, such as Daggers and Spears.
      
      Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of Simple weapons you chose.
      For example, you could switch to using the Mastery properties of Maces and Slings.

      Your self-discipline and martial training allow you to harness a well of
      extraordinary energy within yourself. Your access to this energy is 
      represented by a number of Discipline Points. 
      Your Monk level determines the number of points you have,
      as shown in the Discipline Points column of the Monk table.

      You can spend these points to fuel various Martial Discipline features.

      When you spend a Discipline Point, it is unavailable until you finish
      a Short Rest or Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your
      expended points. Some of your Martial Discipline features 
      require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects

      You can use your Reaction to deflect ranged attacks against you that deal Bludgeoning, 
      Piercing, or Slashing damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced 
      by 1d10 plus your Dexterity modifier plus your Monk level.
      
      If you reduce the damage to 0, you can spend 1 Discipline Point to redirect the attack toward 
      another creature. If you do so, choose a creature within 60 feet of yourself
      that isn’t behind Total Cover.
      That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to 
      two rolls of your Martial Arts die. The damage is the same type dealt by the attack.
