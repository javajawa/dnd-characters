  Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most
  distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of
  trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.

  - name: Favoured Enemy (Dragons)
    description: |-
      Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting,
      and even talking to a certain type of enemy (dragons).

      You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies,
      as well as advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

      When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that
      is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

      You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language,
      at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the
      types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.
  - name: Natural Explorer (Grassland)
    description: |-
      Also at 1st level, you are particularly familiar with one type of natural
      environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions.

      When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain,
      your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.

      While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:
        - Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
        - Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
        - Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling
          (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
        - If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
        - When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
        - While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number,
          their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

      You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.
