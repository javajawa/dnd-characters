  While you have contracted the were-rat lycanthropy trait, you are still able
  to resist the curse in it's purest form.
  
  You may chose to stop resisting the curse at any time becoming a full wererat
  when you do your character becomes an NPC under the DMs control permanently.

  While In your normal from (this is your base humanoid form), you gain a physical
  attribute of your choice associated with the Rat.
  You chose to try and hid this trait from those around you if you do they must
  make a DC20 perception check to notice.
  
  In other forms you gain +2 to dex and a number of other modifiers.
  In full rat form you lose the ability to speak.
  
  You gain resistance to bludgeoning, slashing and piercing damage from non-magical and non-silvered weapons.
  This becomes immunity when you use the ‘embrace change’ ability, until dawn.

      You fully embrace your inner rat; the curse takes ahold of you,
      and you forfeiting control of your PC to the DM until the next sunrise.
      
      If this triggers while you are awake you attack the nearest creature at random.
      On nights of a Full Moon, you most succeed on a DC 15 wisdom save to resist the
      curse taking forcing you to use this ability
      (full moon triggers will be addressed via impact only in game,
      example when you awake your inner rat may have hidden some of your items).
