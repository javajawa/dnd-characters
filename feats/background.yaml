name: Tabaxi
link: http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/tabaxi
description: |-
  Hailing from a strange and distant land, wandering tabaxi are catlike
  humanoids driven by curiosity to collect interesting artifacts,
  gather tales and stories, and lay eyes on all the world's wonders.
  
  Ultimate travelers, the inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long.
  Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost.

abilities:
  - name: Dark-Vision
    description: >-
      You have a cat's keen senses, especially in the dark.
      You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light,
      and in darkness as if it were dim light.
      You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
  - name: Feline Agility
    description: >-
      Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed.
      When you move on your tum in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn.
      Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.
  - name: Cat's Claws
    description: >-
      Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet.
      In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.
      If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier,
      instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

name: Acolyte
link: http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/background:acolyte
description: >-
  You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or pantheon of gods.
  You act as an intermediary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world,
  performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers
  into the presence of the divine.
proficiencies:
  - type: skill
    target: insight
  - type: skill
    target: religion
abilities:
  - name: Shelter of the Faithful
    description: >-
      As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith,
      and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity.
      You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing
      and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith,
      though you must provide any material components needed for spells.
      Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

      You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon,
      and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you used to serve,
      if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home.
      While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance,
      provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in
      good standing with your temple.
