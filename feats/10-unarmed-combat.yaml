  Hailing from a strange and distant land, wandering tabaxi are catlike
  humanoids driven by curiosity to collect interesting artifacts,
  gather tales and stories, and lay eyes on all the world's wonders.

  Ultimate travelers, the inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long.
  Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost.

          While grappled, the opponent can use an action to try escaping.
          They make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check,
          against this attacks save.

      The target is Grappled, and the grapple’s escape DC equals 8 + your Strength modifier + your Proficiency Bonus.
      This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one Size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab the target.

      - A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
      - The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
      - The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect,
        such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunder-wave spell.
