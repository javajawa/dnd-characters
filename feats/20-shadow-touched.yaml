  Your exposure to the Shadowfell's magic has changed you, granting you the following benefits:
  - Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
  - You learn the Invisibility spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice.
    The 1st-level spell must be from the Illusion or Necromancy school of magic.
    You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot.
    Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell
    in this way again until you finish a long rest.
    You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
    The spells' spell casting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

      A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends.
      Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as
      it is on the target’s person.
      The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

          Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as

          The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.
      
          An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense.
          For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured.
          The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
          Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage,
          and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.

      A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand.
      Roll 6d10, the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect.
      Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order
      of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and creatures that can’t see).

      Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points,
      each creature affected by this spell is blinded until the end of your next turn.
      Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the
      creature with the next lowest hit points.
      A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total
      for the creature to be affected.
