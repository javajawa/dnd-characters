backstory:
  "Traits – Sheltered": >-
    I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical
    experience dealing with people in the outside world.
  "Traits – Isolated": >-
    I grew up in a church-as-a-family, with many who loved me,
    but none who were particular close and nurturing.
  "Ideals – Charity": >-
    I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost.
  "Flaws – Piety": >-
    My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.
  "Flaws – Pacifism": >-
    I will not harm a being, unless it is causing harm to me or those around me.
    Even then, I will try to disable rather than kill or destroy
  "Dogma – Eldath": >-
    The philosophy of Eldath is highly advanced. It teaches that peace can only
    come from within and cannot be taught or imposed; it must be readied through
    thought and meditation. The faithful of Eldath should seek stillness and
    thereby find peace. They are to plant trees and green-leaved things and
    tend such things when they need it, wherever they may be.

    Eldathyn are instructed to nurture and aid and not to restrict or punish.
    They may defend but not punish. Eldathyn may work violence only to defend,
    and they may slay nothing of the forest except to prevent it from slaying
    themselves or another under their protection.

    All worshipers of Eldath are to aid fellow Eldathyn and clergy of Silvanus
    and Mielikki whenever possible and give assistance, support, and shelter
    to displaced forest dwellers and those who work to defend ponds marshes,
    and streamside woods everywhere.
    They must swear to take no thinking life save in direst need and to share
    with all beings the beneficial things that grow in or come from running
    water that all may know it and praise Eldath.

  "Bonds – [todo]": >-
    [i need to invent the monetary master and abbess]

  "Location – Al Nophica Abbey": >-
    Although called an Abbey, this cluster of low profile stone buildings sits
    a short walk from a sacred grove and holy sit of Eldath.
    To the South and East, the buildings overlook the confluence of the Triboar
    tributary with the River Surbrin, flowing out of the Evermoors in the North.
    To the North-West, about a kilometre away stands a large wildflower and
    oak tree grove, centred around a still but clear pond and shrine stone.

    https://tea-cats.co.uk/dnd/map.png (Abbey shown in yellow)

    The importance of the site to both druids and clerics who serve the goddess
    is highlighted by the presence of the permanent stone structures that make up the abbey.
    The small group of buildings has enough room to support the needs of itinerant followers,
    pilgrims, and other visitors, up to almost 40 people at the site
    (less in winter when fires might need to be lit and use up space and air).

    Access to the site is by boat crossing the river (no nearby bridges, making it a quiet spot for non-wildlife).

    The construction is designed to minimise the impact on the environment;
    each building is sunk slightly into the earth and has a triangular
    tent-like shape that allows grass and flowers to grow over it.
    Sections are cut out to form skylights/firepits and windows to allow light
    and air to circulate.

    https://i.pinimg.com/originals/32/86/65/32866581f9eaf3da666fa42f97df5a5e.png

    The area includes a group of blockhouses, a couple of small houses for the
    senior members of the church or distinguished guests, a large communal refectory,
    a dedicated recovery ward for those who arrived seeking divine healing,
    a small 'mendery' (with a variety of tools for working with wood, stone,
    and leather), and a modest library chronicling the history of the area
    around the rivers and moors, and both its and other area's flora and fauna.
    The buildings are crafted to minimise the disruption to the natural stillness
    of the land, a practice enhanced by the use of enchanted boundary stones
    to prevent sound from leaving the site.

    (Permanent population of a few clerics, a few druids, some novices/acolytes
    of each, a scribe who maintains the library; an itinerant population of
    nearby rangers (who help bring in food), wandering followers of Eldath and
    related gods, and people seeking healing.)

  "Location – The Monastery": >-
    The Monastery where Light trained to be a monk was located outside of Triboar,
    in the shadow of the Storm Mountains. The hardy group of men and elves act
    as a de facto extra layer of defence for Triboar by "removing" goblins and
    troll groups from the hills.

    https://tea-cats.co.uk/dnd/map.png (Monastery shown in blue)

    The buildings fell like they were hewn from the stone, a testament to the
    strength stored here and the ability to channel power from within rather
    than following the energy from the flow of nature.

    https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ellora-caves-india-mountain-temples-20.jpg?w=400

    The stone halls didn't have any 'civilian' population, just the order of monks.
    Training rooms with dummies and stone floors and such.

  "Backstory – Childhood": >-
    Aged (about) 3, Light was found by one of the boundary markers of the abbey.
    Originally known as "Eldath's Light" for their fur matching the goddess's light,
    they were later given a more traditional Tabaxi name of "Light in the Morning".

    The adults of the site were content to raise this child there; some of the
    older members were parents and grandparents who had raised children before.
    Few knew more of Tabaxi than the name of the race, so there was little
    connection to Tabaxi cultures and traditions, and instead, a range of
    knowledge of the forest was instilled in the young one.

    Being raised in a small religious community rather than a traditional village,
    Light's upbringing was one of quiet contemplation, prayer, and very few
    interactions with people their own age. Some children visited as pilgrims
    or as part of parties to seek healing, but those didn't have time to form
    long term friendships. Once they were old enough to make day trips,
    they were taken to Yartar on trips to spend time away from the abbey.
    Inbetweenwhiles, they spent a lot of time with the scribe and the works
    in the library, and they grew up literate and aware of the world around them.

    What formalised training they did receive included the primary initiation
    into the ceremonies of Eldath and went through some of the basic novice
    training for both the clerical and druidic aspects of faith,
    but none of the magical power came to Light.

  "Backstory – A Visitor": >-
    A lot of Light's understanding of their people and origins comes from a visiting wizard,
    who arrived to pursue some knowledge in the library and was able to shed some light on Light.
    They took the name "Light in the Morning" and learnt of Tabaxi across the ocean in Maztica.

  "Backstory – Teenage Years": >-
    Once they were old enough to be able to help, Light was encouraged to help
    make the abbey/camp a happy and safe place to live.
    This included helping around the hospital and in the refectory,
    along with the standard chores of cleaning and washing.

    As they became older, they helped work the boats and escort travellers from
    Yartar to the abbey, turning the familiar trip into something for a purpose
    and not just pleasure. On these trips, they learnt the basics of defending
    themselves with staff and claw.

    As they matured, Light realised that they did not want to stay in the abbey forever;
    without a path into direct service to the god, they would forever be a hanger-on.
    They considered taking a craft apprenticeship in Yartar, but before they did,
    they were approached by a Monk of a nearby order dedicated to protecting free people.

  "Backstory – Apprentice to Monks": >-
    Having been recruited in Yartar, Light bid farewell to the abbey and
    relocated to the Monastery in the foothills of the Sword Mountains.
    A place of training, meditation, and dedication to the cause,
    the monastery was both familiar and so different a place for Light to live.
    It was still and calm but did not have the same feeling of peace and
    tranquillity as the old abbey.

    At the Monastery, they learnt how to actually use the weapons and the concept
    and potential of Ki. As part of their novice/initiate training,
    they were sent on a raid against a goblin/kobold encampment,
    in which the leader ordered the camp to be set ablaze during the attack.
    Confronted with the death of non-combatants, Light left the part and
    slipped into south Neverwinter Wood.

  "Backstory – On The Run": >-
    Fleeing from their own conscience and the presumed judgement and discipline of the monks,
    Light heads into the Neverwinter Forest to get away from the raiding party.
    They decide not to return to the abbey, seeing as that would be an obvious place to look for them.
    In Conyberry, they meet Glint and Bram and are recruited to join the adventure.

  "Session Log – Session 1 (The Fading, 8th)": |-
    Bram has a holy symbol that looks like a dragon claw -- Bahamut.
    Learnt about the Cat Lord from new best friend Glint.
    Kolbold with white scales on the shield?
    Tiefling who stabs sleeping kobolds.
    Oh no, a Dragon. I forgot to write down their name. It was Cryovain.
    The dragon seems to want to eat everything.
    Changling Tiefling pushed the kobold out of the cart!
    There's a lot of plotting going on :/

  "Session Log – Session 2 (The Fading, 8th/9th)": |
    Innkeeper of Phandalin is human, Toblin Stonehill, from Triboar.
    There's an ex-Sheriff 40mi east "Big Al" (Alfonse Kalazorn)

    Town-Master Harbin Western, leading Phandalin
      Wouldn't come out.
      Had quests
      Scared as all fuck.

  "Session Log – Session 3 (The Fading, 9th)": |
    Smithy
      Dwarven smith (Alger) and Human apprentice.
      Made some magical moonblades (inverse scythes)
      Alger seems to be willing to actually work towards defeating the dragon, but makes blades (ewwwww).

    The local midwife — an acolyte of Chauntea named Adabra Gwynn — lives by herself in a stone windmill on the side of a hill a few miles south of Phandalin. With dragon sightings becoming more common, it’s not safe for her to be alone. Urge Adabra to return to Phandalin. Once she’s safe, visit Town-Master Harbin Wester to claim a reward of 25 gp.

    At The Windmill
      30% grade hill is a fun climb!
      Ooo, that _hurt_. I got jumped by some very scary monster.
      Landan is good healer
      Bezlik casts spells!!
      This Manticore is tough. But we got it

      Hey, we found Adabra! She's an alchemy type person. Got dem good potions.
      She does not want to leave. Why am I not surprised.
      Well, we let her stay, and we got some letters (and some manticore spikes)

      Popped into the miner's guild, and reported back to the Town Master [level up sound]

      Found us a Glint who found an elder half-elf, sounds like they had a great time in the orchard.

  "Session Log – Session 4 (The Fading, 9th/10th)": |
    Sleepy times. Very important. Glint seems rather upset with just how Fine we were on our trip.

    "All Druids Welcomes At Alderleaf Farm." -- seen on the side of the well by the shrine in town.

    Bezlik hasn't quite worked out the ears on a Tabaxi. At least Glint can tell Light and Light!Bezlik apart.

    We're going to the...[drum roll please] the Gnomes.
    We have found them be following a stream (Light got to lead the pad-pad) and found their magical mushrooms.
    And their waterfall. Their very very loud waterfall. WHICH WE CAN'T HEAR EACH OTHER OVER!!
    Found a way in, and we eventually find the kitchen of the gnomes! Legendary bread and mushroom facilities.
    Fibblestib and Dabbledob are the artificers. We should go visit them, but maybe not going via the Crazy Gnome who is testing their fully automatic omni-directional crossbow machine. Are we going to BE FINE(tm) again?
    During the battle, people disappeared and reappeared elsewhere, Glint grew wings and lights, Bezlik turned blue, and Sleep eventually took this thing down. Good old Sleep. We love sleep.
    Landan raised the idea of building a bigger, more dragon killing version to the now captured gnome friend.

    The teleported friends found some guards who are on the lookout for shape-shifters, very aggressively. Crossbow aggressive :3
    We have some tense negotiations as we shuffle through trying to prove that we are friends, not shape-shifters, as neither is true.
    They do not believe Light. Even after I loafed!

  "Session Log – Session 5 (The Fading, 10th)": |
    Bezlik declared as "I am Bezlikoye, Changeling, and servant of Ma'eyt".
    That scared the big-jebsus out of the gnomish guards who went running.
    Light let the mad engineering gnome go free (and reclaim my rope) ready to work out how to get a Centaur across a narrow rope bridge.

    The rope bridge does not like our mass. Glint is flying around, leaving the spinning blades round. Bezlik is climbing down into a river, Landan is not, Bram has gone the long way around, and Light is stuck in the middle splitting the party even more. Who knows where Glint is, who knows what Landan is going to do.
    All Light knows is that they are wet, their head hurts from the noise of the waterfall, and so far this is possibly worse that the whole manticore incident.

    [OOC] Glint found Fibblestib(m) and Dabbledob(f) have been found by a Glint.
    Light make it up a slope, but there's nowhere to tie up the rope to help the others up.

    The Benny Hill Theme plays. Glint does one full loop of the tunnels and makes some new friends in the time in the time it takes up to wade the river and climb into the dormitory.
    Bram isn't good with steep slopes, damaged the manticore-nommed leg again :( But we have found the foreman/chief inventor gnomes.

    Glint "I turned off the Spinning Death Blades"
    Bram "The What?"
    Glint "Don't even worry about it, I turned them off"

    Gods, we made it in to a laboratory with useful people. This room is full of *things* and *stuff* which is exciting.
    Hey, these people know the difference between shape-shifters and shape-changers. Light still doesn't, but hopefully they're learning.

    Right, the kings are a couple who are...out of it. They're locked up in their room worrying about shape-changers. The fore-gnomes seem to think that one has gone insane and is holding the other.
    Someone finally explains the difference (in character) between changelings and doppelgangers and shape-changers. Let's hope that Light was paying attention and not essentially hissing at everything.

    There might also be a green dragon in the area (v.OOC).

    Kings claim there is a problem, in that a carpet in the throne room ate a gnome (Nia). Fibble said that they probably just left -- people come and go all the time.
    Throne room does not have a carpet -- but there is a faint outline of where one was.
    And it looks like we have a mimic.

    [OOC] Gnome poking things brigade: ACTIVATE!!
    Bram kicking heavy doors: ACTIVATE!!
    Glint jumping off the damn bridge into the river: ACTIVATE!!

    Pog is also missing. (eyyyyy, aren't we all missing a Pog >.<). There's a keg gone from the wine cellar too, signs of struggle and their is a stray plate! Such chaos. Also, the mug Pog went to fill isn't there.
    [OOC] Back over by the king's bedchambers, the talking is going...poorly. There's keyhole spying, spell transcribing, and all sorts of drama. Oh, and Dobby is guarding the door.

  "Session Log – Session 6 (The Fading, 10th)": |
    [OOC] Landan has a fancy book.

    Oh good, the quad firing crossbow machine has been re-manned (re-gnomed) by...the left half of Pog. Who has been...melted by acid (probably from the nom nom, but maybe Dale has entered the scene). Light has no brain in this moment.

    Bram feel down a cliff, Glint is panicking, and Bezlik we found the cooks looking very beat up and they reckon they trapped it up North...but it came from the wrong direction than one would expect given where Pog's body is. This is all going swimmingly (with far too much swimming).
    Light is still very much having a headache and not thinking well, to the point that they still haven't realised that there is probably more than one mimic. Or that sending off Glint by themself is a terrible idea as she'll panic and cause more problems.
    [OOC] Landan also seems to be doing a bit of a panic, and has jumped into the water.

    Bezlik appears to have some idea what is going on, and has given Light a direction, so they've just forded the stream to make sure Bram is safe from a potential mimics -- and has potentially spotted something wrong with the mushrooms. Landan got Bram back up, and turned blue!

    Light really needs to stop engaging and taking aggro -- even the shield assist from Bram isn't enough to stop Light going down in round 2. I'm sure the 5 points of acid damage is not a problem. Nor is the natural 1 on the first death save. Everything Is Fine. Hopefully Bezlik's tactical plan of "summon gnomes" will stop things going Fine for too much longer. And maybe someone will get Light up before permadeath.

    Good news: a half-naked Landan turned More Blue and got 7 hit points back onto Light! Hurray!
    More good new: Eldritch Blast, it turns out, is a wonderful support spell if by support spell you mean combat spell.
    Triple good news: Ooo, we're getting mimic info: oh good, this one has already taken some damage (it is the one from the kitchen). Frankly, Bezlik carried this battle, with Landan keeping the fools alive. Glint did...nothing, poor thing, with a little sling.
    Less good news: Bram went down again, and we are 100% out of healing spell capability

    Short rest time, get dry. cook some mushrooms, heal up a bit. Now to drag a mimic around the place and talk to the Kings. Oh, and Landan got something put in his book. The King let his husband up, who wasn't only tied down but also glued to the chair. We have been given items 1, 3, and 18 from the vaults, and things are Going Well (not to be confused with Going Fine).

    "1" is wand of pyrotechnics, "3" is a giant pendant amulet (unidentified), and "18" is some kind of 1ft rod (unidentified)?
    Also, the tied up king give us a wizzard's [sic] hat.

    [OOC] Bezlik tried to shift in front of the Kings, and things went sideways. The form shift didn't actually take place, and there was a scary booming voice...and Light saw none of this.

    Things Light _may_ have learned from this expedition:
     - Glint might be an bumbling idiot
     - Rushing in is a good way to get ganked
     - People and situations are complicated and evolve quicker than they are used to thinking

    Things Light _has_ learnt from this expedition:
     - Healing boops! (well technically returning and handing in the quest does that)

  "Session Log – Session 7 (The Fading, 10th/11th)": |
    Back to town, sold off the Wizzard Hat for 55gp

    Party split up to run errands. Bezlik got us the rooms

    Landan and I head to Barthen's Provisions, where a Bugbear and an ex-bodybuilder-looking human were having an argument with Elmar.
    The inside doesn't feel right...something about Red Bands? Still seems happy to see Landan.
    Seemed unaware of where his stock was when finding the herbalism kit, and really wanted us out.
    [OOC] Shakedown! We have some "vigilantes" (Red Bands) in town >.<

    Glint and Bram off to meet Daran, the half-elf in Orchard
    [OOC] ex-fighter, has a great sword behind the door
    Mushroom wine is delivered, and partially consumed.

    Light learns what a shakedown is! Light has found a way the day _can_ get worse.

    Morning comes. Light finds the Orchard!
    [OOC] Bezlik has had to go off (for ooc reasons).
    [OOC] Bram has a shiny new oath and not a lot of sleep.
    Glint has a shiny new book! It has weird semi-text in it.

    Elmar, from the supplies store, has a dwarf supplier Gundren Rockseeker has not turned up, and he's worried. We might be all off on another advantage

    We went up the path, found the dead horses...and got jumped by 4 goblins. Light did some fancy running to engage one pair, and took them out...including collapsing one's chest in on itself.
    The rest got cleaned up very quick (combat lasted less than a round).

    Bram got Light to snap out of the "oh no I hurt something" stance by pointing out the one who still is up. Glint speaks Goblin!
    Captured Goblin tells us there are at least 15 goblins at the lair, led by a non-goblin who is uglier and hairier than Landan.
    Black Spider hired King Grol wanted the Dwarf who was running the supply cart.
    On being released, they attempted to sneak back pass us, and got fire-bolted.

    Tracks heading to the North imply the cart was _carried_ off by the goblins (not dragged)

    Searching the bodies gave us:
     - Some saddlebags for more Bram pockets
     - 2 gp

    Back at the beginning of the right, Light spotted a book that was a Dwarven journal.
    [OOC] seems to be about a recovered magical dwarven forge

    https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/969593357825376276/1010638513672310865/unknown.png

    Manor in town is named for the Lord mentioned in the passage
    [OOC] The ruined house in the east of town is where the entrance probably is entrance?

    We set off after the tracks, and we now have traps! There was one rope snare trap, and a giant covered hole (which was probably dug after the cart was carried across)
    And we arrive at A LOCATION. As we get closer, we see a stream/brook flowing out of our destination.

  "Session Log – Session 8 (The Fading, 11th)": |
    Time to investigate this here cave!
    We find no traps, three sentries already stabbed to death.
    Bezlik returns, with the ability to Summon Greater Crossbow.
    The inside of the cave is stone. Goddarn stone

    Inside the cave there are wolves! And stealthy enemies! And very painful spear.
    And a mage who made Landan and Light very afraid.

    The Kobold we let go in session 1 is called 'Frigidfang', appearantly,
    and they appear to be attempting to kill us.
    Wolves are free! We're going down! Everything in fine!
    Lots of new powers showing up, like we all recently levelled up or something.

    The Kobolds might be trying to run/fly away, or just repositioning on us.

    Bezlik has a nemesis, become a balloon, and is honestly having a swell time.

    These notes are very incomplete because brain. I did get chocolates IRL.

  "Session Log – Session 9 (The Fading, 11th)": |
    Kobold encounter! The healer went down first, quickly traded for a kobold.
    Three kobolds come out of the shadows, Landan is brought up, Light gets a
    bruise and a stab and then magiced into a frag.
    Light managed to go down twice in this combat! The second time for their
    own silly reasons.

    In the room we found:
      - magical rope
      - a grappling hook
      - a note for capturing the merchant, signed by King Grol
      - the cart stuff!
      - including potions, money, and maybe some other things?
      - no sign of the driver friend

    Light heard a human-ish voice being harassed by some Goblins (hey, there's still some of those around).
    Before taking our rest (which we really, really needed), we manage to prevent the defence water from flooding away and potentially trapping us out.

    A rest occurred. 3 hit dice wasn't enough for me to fully heal up, but the group overall is looking a lot better. We head back inside, and cross the bridge and find...the goblins! One might be called Klarg. They spot the light coming from our party, and...we somehow get into a hostage negotiation! Bram is summoned into the room to try and secure release of the captive.

    Bram successfully negotiated the release of the human, after the goblin found out they were now in charge. Turns out that power corrupts, or some such. The human we rescues it apparently called Sildar Hallwinter, and doesn't seem to know much apart from their being a 'the castle' -- possibly 'Cragmaw Castle'.

    Our captured kobold has been...burnt to a crisp! Along with Rope-Chan the First!
    The rope is dead...long live the rope!

    We head back towards town!

  "Session Log – Session 10 (The Fading, 11th)": |
    Sildar info dump: Sildar is a member of The Lords Alliance. Joined the Rocksseeker's caravan to get to Phandalin un-harassed. Heading there to find a fellow alliance member, looking for wizard Iarno Albrek (disappeared a few months ago). Iarno was meant to preserve order, but instead we have the Red Band instead, and a mayor who won't come outside.
    Upon learning of the plan to re-poen the mines, he pledged to that caused. The Rockseeker brother he was travelling with had a map to the magic mines in Wave-echo Cave.

    We return to the town, and return to the provisioner who sent us after Gundred Rockseeker; we filled them in on what we know (no dwarf, no map, lots of goblins and kobolds chasing them).
    We got the pearl and another 100G!
    And a hint that the Red Bands aren't the only problem around here...

    [OOC] Bezlik things: Tower of Storms is something they are looking for? My mind slipped off this section of conversation. "That which you seek fell to the lure of the Tower of Storms, Search the property of the fallen to find that which you seek."
    [Very OOC] oh, the Tower of Storms is a lighthouse on the coast!

    Sildar, the Lord Alliance friend, is going to stay with Daran, the half-elf over at the orchard. Glint, Bram, and Bezlik take him over there.

    Walking into the inn, there are three Dragonborn at one table, and an eldery human by the fireplace. One of the Dragonborn is younger and a black dragonborn, and is familiar to Light for some reason. At quick glance, the human is in travelling gear.

    The dragonborn...frankly look like an adventuring party:
     - Dreamer (he/him), crystal == scholarly
     - Basher (she/her), bronze == oldest, heavy leathers + magic hammer
     - Faithful (they/them), black == robes, necklace, youngest.

    We get food and I definitely don't have a weird interaction with the innkeeper finding out where the Alderleaf Farm.

    Bronze dragonborn is Basher, Bezlik knows he had an apprenticeship with a blacksmith in Bezlik's home town. Also, Bram rescued them? Anyway, they, are on the way to start a new magic shop down the high road in Leilon (going to be called the Dragon's Emporium) -- and they're carrying a bunch of magic items. They deliver the centaur armour they made for Bram, but they are also carrying some cool things including plushies of resist fear.
    Bezlik buys a wand of magic missile darts.

    Bram backstory unlock: became a paladin when Bahamut called upon on them to save a town? (Help my brain pulled out when doing this)

    Light's Nightmare:
     - Goblin crunching sound
     - Field of dead goblins and kobolds
     - Blood on their fur
     - Oh look its the monastery master, the angry human
     - Order to burn everything down
     - Whip made of wire around goblin throat
     - Run through with rapier

    Landan's Nightmare:
     - Crystal dragon born was at wizard college with Landan, ~3 years younger
     - weren't interacting, was in the artificer labs
     - seeing all the members of the group
     - all the group encircled around a book like the one Landan carries, chanting
     - they're doing a thing...and the book eats the group? with implosions~
     [ a school building was destroyed ]

    [OOC] The warlocks have warlock chats! They determine patrons, and a bit of what is up with Bezlik's time stopping mentor.
    [OOC] Bezlik has unlocked the ability to mix forms.

    At the farm, an older halfling is running the farm Qelline Alderleaf.

    Light trauma dumps, and gets a referral to Reidoth, who inspected the ruins of Thundertree, some tea, and adorable flowers behind the ears.
    
    Qelline has a child called Carp (potat!!).

    Light goes the long way back, and notices the tavern (the Sleeping Giant) is full of Red Band folk -- 5 in total, 2 heading towards the east, also hear two voices nearer the inn who also seem to be Red Band affiliated.

  "Session Log – Session 11 (The Fading, 12th)": |
    On returning to the inn, Light meets Faithful coming down the stairs...who knows Light from the Abbey! They left the Abbey about a year ago aged 10ish as the youngest cleric (and aspiring tailor), looking for friendly folks to send back to the abbey.
    The pair get breakfast (porridge with berries); Faithful confirms the existence of one lage green dragon, and one small green dragon, as well as the white dragon we already know about.
    They also confirm that Eldath is good with the whole self-defence thing.
    After catching up, the dragonborn and the missing PCs head off to Leilon (and Light promises to visit).

    [OOC Knowledge] Bezlik (she/her) comes down in a female Elf 'mirth' form. She sits next to the mysterious older man by the fireplace, and finds out that he recently came into possession of a nearby mine (and might be a escort quest). He had a shop near Neverwinter that Bezlik (and Landan?), so must be new in the area. Real big bragger, but seems to believe what he is saying.

    Bezlik checks in on Landan, who is busy.

    Bezlik and Light compare notes -- the green dragons are probably looking to (re)claim the region for the younger dragon -- there was a ancient dragon (Old Gnawbone) in the Neverwinter Wood, and there was a non-ancient one killed on the Dragon Barrow. (Hey, maybe we can turn the greens against the white??)

    Landan appears! They've been having a "great time" working on the holy symbol. "Still needs a bit of work, but shouldn't be an issue".

    Planning commences. Known problems and priorities, in order of fearfulness:
     - A White Dragon with a fanatic kobold army.
     - An elder green dragon and it's offspring.
     - "Black Spider" who hired King Ghrol to capture a dwarf to help find a magical forge.
     - The Red Band plaguing the town.
     - Insufficient nyaps.
     - Visting the Dwaven excavation
     - Seeing the old man to his mine

    Bezlik Miqo'te reveal! No-one is impressed, because no-one understands what is going on.

    We step outside to go visit the QUEST BOARD, and are greeted by NEW MAP.
    This map contains people shouting "it's him" and firing arrows. What people? Who can say. But there's one on the roof! And that sure is an arrow sticking out of Landan...looking like we're gearing up for Everything To Be Fine.

    Flying is cheating. How is Light meant to punch something that is flying?
    Making Light purple is cheating. Light has a clear, well-defined colour scheme. If you cast faerie fire on Light, it should be yellow.

    "Welcome to taking damage! I know this is a new experience for you!" -- Randus to Zvothur.

    A critical bonk occurred, followed by a critical bolt (which took out our flying friend).

    Things Light has been told not to worry about:
     - The fangs on the male 'elf'
     - The fangs biting Light
     - The long sword the elf has
     - That elf in general
     - The damage roll from the long sword
     - The 10 psychic damage that downed Light
     - This entire raider group seeming Not Right

    The blade-singer elf is called Ella! I wonder if she also has fangs...

    "Not actually a vampire...just be very clear" -- Randus

    Bezlik, known to our attackers to be pest, goes down.
    Light goes down to psychic damage (such a surprise).

    When we are all out (Landan via sleep), the Elves took Landan's book and ran away.
    Sildar turned up just too late to save Bezlik from a critical death save failure.
    Upon coming around, Light finds Landan and a dead Bezlik...and performs a 40 second cross-town sprint carrying Bezlik to Alderleaf Farm in the hopes of a revivify -- and is about 30 seconds too slow. Bezlik's soul doesn't want to be reincarnated in some random body, and so we start saying our goodbyes.

    "We have only marginally traumatised the boy. That's something" -- Kitteh

    Light's bite wound: there's no blood...and a magical residue! I'm sure that is fine. Leading theory is something similar to a Dhampir.

    We begin the prepatory work to bury Bezlik's body and wait for Bram and Glint to return.

  "Interlude – Landan's Backstory": >-
    Backstory for Landan - short version, About 5 years back, Landan was training to be a Wizard, and got stuck in a pseudo-gig economy thing that was researching the difference between arcane and divine magic at a structural level.  On a day that Landan was making up some study time, that research group, "The Weave Research Collective," was destroyed by an explosion of some kind of white energy.
    In the rubble he found no survivors, but a box with the book Ella took and what is now his holy symbol, Landan found himself unable to cast spells as a Wizard, as though his brain had been rewired, but can now cast as a Cleric.
    Currently doesn't know who his deity is, or if he isn't just a REALLY weird wizard who is effectively just a Cleric.
    In the past 5 years he's been learning the office-side works of a Cleric, as well as trying to pick up any information on what might've happened on the divine side of stuff.
    While he has a really bad reputation in the city that he was training to be a Wizard in, it hasn't been an issue so far.

  "Session Log – Session 12 (The Fading, 12th/13th)": |
    We start digging a grave.

    Light takes a visit to the inn to tell Toblin about the attack to their property, and is dispatched to visit the woodworker (Thel Dendrar) to get some repairs. He's entertaining when we arrive, and the door is answered by Mirna (possibly wife?). Thel comes out with a very pretty Tiefling (Zvothur's new character Narthian) who seems to be visiting.

    Meanwhile, Landan discusses gods with Daran at the Orchard. Daran learns of Landan's god problem.

    Narthian new character finds the evidence of Aarakocra stalking on the windowsill; this gets reported to Sildar in a _very communicative manner_. She is sent off to report these findings to us.

    Visited the Smithy to commission a small grave marker for Bezlik, and found out that there are Chakram are for sale.

    Narthian's obvious gear:
      - longbow
      - buckler
      - short sword
      - scimitar
      - woodland smell

    LANDAN IS A SMOL!! (5'4") (I didn't previously realise this)

    More digging. Grave complete.

    Return to the smithy (late) (but Light learnt about clocks!). The grave marker is complete, and Light spends 20gp on a Chakram.

    We have been offered a discount on the room rates!
    Landan identified the dagger! It's the Dagger of Misdirection -- it acts as a hologram anchor creating a spectral copy of the wielder that spells can come from.
    We head to bed.

    Narthian learns about the Red Bands and how they should be put back in their place (during their own dinner). She then heads out into the outskirt woods to set up a small camp for themselves in a tree lean-to.

    In the morning, Light revisits the shrine (which is dedicated to Tymora), and investigates the Sister Garaele's house. There's fancy lace curtains, something that I saw as a metal item on the table, and it is notably untouched by the Red Bands. Light draw a conclusion that this building is _weird_.

    (Holy moly I am rolling poorly today)

    Landan uses Locate Object but can not find the item. Booo. Menas its either a long way away, or has been shielded with lead. Landan grows even more concerned.

    Narthian also likes to visit the shrine in the morning...and has decided to follow Light back to the inn to ask what the Red Bands are. Toblin the innkeeper seems upset about this line of conversation, so Narthian takes us outside to the town green (not quiet a water cooler chat around the well, sorry Randus).

    "Congraulations Narthian, you have become leader and acquired a Monk and a Cleric. Uses them as you will"

    Narthian has a range along the Triboar trail, fighting things as needed. They want to clear out the Red Bands; we will pick them up when the rest of the part is back.

    Town trip, selling all the extra stuff from Bezlik.
    Barthen's Provisions:
      - Reassured him that we are still look for Rockseeker.

    Lionshild Coster:
      - Silvering weapons discount (only 75gp) continues -- end 18th day of the fading.

    Quest Board Update:
      - Orcs have attacked Butterskull Ranch, five miles east of Conyberry along the Triboar Trail! Travel there with haste, assess the damage, and help any way you can. Ranch owner Alfonse “Big Al” Kalazorn is a retired sheriff who can reward you for your efforts. If he’s dead, return to Town-Master Harbin Wester with proof of Kalazorn’s demise to receive a reward of 100 gp.
      - Deep in Neverwinter Wood, along the river that flows west toward Neverwinter, is a logging camp. Every two months, Phandalin delivers fresh supplies to the camp, which is run by the half-brother of Phandalin’s town-master, Harbin Wester. Barthen, the local provisioner, has prepared a new delivery. He needs someone to bear the supplies safely to the camp. Return to Harbin Wester with a notice of delivery signed by his half-brother, Tibor Wester, to claim your reward of 100 gp.
      - The Mountain’s Toe Gold Mine lies fifteen miles northeast of Phandalin. The new overseer, Don-Jon Raskin, just made the trip from Neverwinter to Phandalin and needs to be escorted to the mine. There’s no telling what dangers lie between here and there. Once you deliver Raskin safe and sound, return to Town-Master Harbin Wester to collect a reward of 100 gp.

    We visit the town-master to ask about Sister Garaele -- the town-master is rather distraught that quest items have been arriving in fur (or horse hair). Apparently she is on the way to Neverwinter; her disappearing for weeks or months at a time. "She can take care of herself".
    We find out that the Tower of Storms is probably the lighthouse at the Western end of the Triboar Trial.
    Landan and Light head South picking herbs (not very successfully) and visit Adabra. We take up the offer of the half price potion, and also get an updated sale list (potions, poisons, and some helpful books that both Landan and Light would love to buy).

    We share tea, and talk about the weather. We all notice that there have been multiple localised lightning storms...at the Tower of Storms. Landan barters for a book on local legends (which is going to be real useful). There's a lot of local legends in there -- including 'Fall of Thundertree' (recent); 'Fall of Conyberry'; and the story of Lady Alagondar who defeated a green dragon.
    On the subject of the Tower of Storms, it was once a place of worship for Talos (a Chaotic Evil God of Storms).

    Narthian heads off to scout the mansion, and headed North towards in Triboar Trail.

    We return to the inn to find a returned Bram and Glint.

  "Session Log – Session 13 (The Fading, 13th/early 14th)": |
    Mint??? (What's a Mint?)
    "It's OK, It's OK, they're friendly...we think" -- Bram, on Mint.

    Sildar informs Bram and Glint of a death and, having been up for over 24 hours, is escorted back to the orchard to get some rest.
    They then find a returning Light and Landan; there are hugs. Also, Glint has a gooish skull with a sapphire eye on her shoulder called Mint. They also recovered Landan's book (which is returned, slightly changed). The skull (who is calling Glint 'mama', though only Glint can hear the voice) is a sort of gelatinous cube with the skull inside it. It can also move of its own accord, it seems...and they change forms when they hear their name).

    https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1036777256812552244/1036797947494531072/unknown.png

    The Aarakocra that killed Bezlik seems to have been offed by Cryovain (judging by the eating and frozen state the body was found in).

    The book now has additional, higher level spells.

    We proceed to the Bury Bezlik step, with various rituals (planting saplings, etc.).

    Planing Step:
     - Time to push these Red Bands
     - The leader is called "The Glass Staff".
    Prep Work:
     - Acquire Narthian
     - Have manacles made
     - Wait until night
    Phase 1:
     - "Two Tabaxi walk into a bar..."
     - Bar Fight
    Phase 2:
     - Smoke them out of the mansion

    Narthian wasn't at home. So this is already going swimmingly. A note has been left.

    15 manacles have been ordered (from the apprentice?) for 30gp. On returning to the inn, a very much lighter coin purse is given over to Bram. Dinner is consumed (including by Mint).

    The Mint based moon alarm clock works.

    "DM, I headpat the ooze."

    We set off to the Inn -- Light spots 6 inside, and we set up for "Two Tabaxi Walk Into A Bar". Glint gets off the start of the fight...by getting stabbed twice and lighting someone on fire. The fight goes...ok. Light manages to successfully engage 3 sober double attackers. Light gets their second ever kill (booo) and [about an hour of combat got lost here. We only killed...four, no wait five of the seven.

    Kitteh rolled about 10 natural ones in the session, 6 of them on a d20 (plus a bunch of d4 and d6).

  "Session Log – Session 14 (The Fading, 14th early morning)": |
    Narthian update: she's back! And scored -2 on her first intimidation check. The captive in question bites her boot, and gets killed by a scimitar.
    The second captive gets just the butt of the sword, which Light is not fast enough to deflect.

    Glint is taking the remaining captive back to the Orchard.

    Landan is roped into fixing the inn, and Bram and Light go to recover the body of the one who tried to escape down the road. Light is approached by a squirrel bearing a note and a mask, both from Qelline Alderleaf.
    https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/896383431120932915/1048658399346294784/image.png
    https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5842527-elder-leaf-mask

    We return to the bar to find that a group was there to keep an eye on the inn -- and presumably us. Bodies are moved around to the back of the bar, and a short rest is had before we head off towards the manor. Light does some _very basic_ scouting (determining we're safe to at least approach the front door -- what's left of it). Light is leading the non-dark-vision havers on a lead rope up to the building.

    The main floor of the building is abandoned, apart from Thel the woodworker. His family has been taken by the Red Bands earlier in the day, and his bruised self thought he could do something about it. We enable our lights and start exploring the ruins for the secret entrances. Landan fails a wisdom saves and zooms off to recover...his holy book. Upon touching it, the holy book...glows green and crumbled to dust. Landan's book glows green. (Note: the glows are not known to Light). I'm sure all of this is 100% ok.
    https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/969993077638971442/1048684811432235048/image.png

    Narthian finds some traps and a probable entrance, and does not make the best stealth roll.

    We descend into the sub levels, where we find...a big room with a big font/cistern (which has a bag floating in it, tied to be below the surface) and a bunch of pantry supplies. The bag turns out to be a bolt bag with various useful (and expensive) things. Oh, and it poisoned Light >.< (thank you Bram for the healing). We discovered a secret door to the west, and the sounds of Thel's wife to the north.

  "Session Log – Session 15 (The Fading, 14th early morning)": |
    Glint Update: The bandit was eventually taken to the orchard! And she catches up. And tells Light not to talk to strangers????

    We head north into a corridor with a _lot_ of box text, including an angel double door at the end.
    And traps! The floor falls away, and Narthian is caught by Light. The party has a conversation about where to go, and Glint...falls in the hole. gdi Glint. Light eventually convinces the part to turn around and look at the other doors.

    The north of the western pair of doors goes to a small dorm/barracks (vacated), and the southern one opens...onto a underground crevice. We explore, and find...Thel's body. Oh now, we have a dark elf impostor! With magic and some kind of beast(s). It's also doing a lot of psychic attacks to  We leap into action (very slowly).
    It's friends are Nothics! https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/14/475/1000/1000/636364321398842272.png

    We get covered in magical darkness. Glint immediately gets distracted by a treasure chest and falling off things again. Light makes a daring leap across the chasm in order to...ok, look, it made sense at the time. The rest of the party uses their turns much more sensibly, including Narthian actually dealing damage. The darkness dropes at the end of the round, leaving just the Nothic visible.

    "Ah, where was I...right, I was looking at fun spells to screw with you" -- Randus

    Narthian and Light take down the Nothic, but the image friend has disappeared out into the forest.

    The treasure chest contains a long sword in silver scabbard (not scarab). It's got a bird of prey hilt and a inscribed. Also there is a bunch of money, some potions and some spell scrolls.

    The chasm itself is...magical? Thel's body is decomposing slower than it should do. There are more skeletons around, (2 to 5 humans) that also seem pristine. We recover Thel's body and cover it.

    Heading North again, we find...a storage area and another secret door. Glint opens the door and triggers...skeletons. Excellent. Combat #2, and we're still not actually heading in the correct direction to save the hostages (assuming they every actually existed...). Light also rolls above passive perception for once! The skeletons have skeletal short swords. Light crit fails the shove to move glint out of the line of fire/stab, Landan does a wonderful turn undead, and the entire fight is a bit messy because there are 5 characters and 3 tiles to stand on. As we're dealing with the skeletons, a one-horned tiefling pops open the side door on the passage and stabs Landan. Reactions go on the stack. So many reactions. Light runs in, rather foolishly, and comes face-to-face with a maul wielding barbarian. Nuts are kicked, mauls are flailed, sacred is breathed, and no party members goes down.

    The bodies are looted. Glint acquires new armour and everyone gains infinite ammunition.

  "Session Log – Session 16 (The Fading, 14th morning)": |
    The session starts with the DM taking stock of our situation, our resources, and liabilities (i.e. the entire party). While rummaging we find some magic items we lost in our pockets, and work out who should have them. Oh, and Augury was used up on the sword, confirming it isn't too bad an idea to wield. And now, on with the show!

    The tomb room has some more box text; the pillars have oak design on the bottoms, and the other sides of the double Angel doors. This is a family crypt, with generic angels for the family of many religions. Narthian checks the graves and lo and behold _doesn't loot them_.

    Glint has gone for the remaining door, which appears to be where the whimpering was coming from. Showing an amazing amount of sense, she sends a silent image through the door, and Light *attempts* to react to the two swords swinging down by throwing a Chakram...and ends up last in initiative. Narthian gets off a clean shot, and they find out that stabbing Glint ends in a firey hellish rebuke death.

    We have found prisoners! In actual cells! Hey, if we'd known there are cells here, we could have saved money on those manacles if we knew this was here. The second person surrenders _successfully_, and gets manacled.
    Inside the (straw lined, toilet-less) cells do contain Thel's family, and Light manages to use some basic leverage principles to open the cells. Also, the fiend appearantly doesn't attack people in cloaks (and some of the traps will also not be triggered). We all acquire cloaks, and Narthian escorts the family and the prisoner to orchard.

    People:
      - Guys out front
      - The Glass Staff
      - At least 12 people
      - Hairy fuckers who think they run the place
      - The goblin Droop, who might be fren?

    Items are attuned, Landan's new glass dagger starts glowing yellow, and Narthian gets the drop on us on her return. We cross the chasm, and prepare to open the door. Two attempts were made to detect the ambush, both failed, and Light gets three, no four, weapons directly to them and promptly keels over. Combat ensues: crits do in fact hit, "Lay on Hoof" occurs, Light gets their first taste of mounted combat, Narthian gets spider climb mode engaged, and gets to do some fun trick shots, and Landan and Glint go off on their own adventure. Light gains another kill, Landan and Glint re-engage from the South.

    Everyone is confused which one is Glint and which one is Light.

    Randus offers to drop initiative. We politely decline. The Goblin Droop has been located to the South along with bug bears. Narthian gets to open this door, and crits do continue to hit (funny that), but so do maces, javelins, and Narthian's third crit of the evening. Light manages to overturn a table and punch a door to pieces. Crits continue to hit, this time in the form of a Glint firebolt. Mosk, the bug bear, goes down to a punch to the nuts.

  "Session Log – Session 17 (The Fading, 14th)": |
    Recovering after the fight with the bugbears, Narthian hears a sound from the chasm which I'm sure will be nothing and is definitely not the new player character Faelar the pale skinned blade-singer elf staking us. Faelar is not to be confused with Ella, the blade-singer elf who attacks people in the town square for books. He's also not to be confused by the Drow-like friend who was previous tricking us into things and could have easily looped back to kill us.

    Droop, the friendly goblin who Nars had suggested would be around, is still cowering under the bed; Glint (who speaks goblin) goes to reassure them that they're not going to be attack by us...although not before Droop tried to pick up one of the Bugbear's maces to defend himself with. This...went as you would expect with a weak goblin picking up a mace built for someone twice their height, when they drop it on themselves. At the same time Landan and Bram, meanwhile, are planning to barricade the door to the North to ensure we don't get flanked, and talk about burning the place down. Facing a Goblin calling for mercy and the plan to burn the place down, Light breaks down and sends the rest of the session in some amount of trauma haze.

    Glint is able to get *some* useful information out of Droop, namely that there are Slave pens (which are *cough* left, up, right, up, left -- I'm sure this is useful information and not just a confused gobbo). Light fails their con save against not hyperventilating. Everyone agrees that slave pens are bad (and any plans of burning the place down are abandoned). Faelar agrees that slave pens are bad, and enters into some form of stand off with Narthian with regards to "I want you to make yourself visible" and "I'm happy to do that when you're not pointing a nooked bow at me". This is eventually resolved by way of the invisibility spell running out, and Faelar being, very clearly, not the drow (unless they're in disguise again). Narthian calls Bram over to help work this out; Bram has picked up Light's physical form and at least 4 of their brain cells, and Light will remain on their back for the rest of the session.

    Faelar is six foot tall high elf, with pale skin, blue eyes, and blonde hair. As Bram establishes Faelar as a non-hostile (or maybe even friend) due to their connection to Daran, Droop is being brought up by Glint. (At this point, we are reminded that Mint is present. Also it appears that Glint is going to adopt every smol we run into). Droop acquires Mosk's jeweled eyepatch (possibly magical, as Mosks eyes seem to be fine) as declares that "I in charge now". Narthian resumes communion with floor-chan (albeit temporarily).

    Operations GTFO commences, and is interrupted as we cross the chasm by the sounds of someone in the storeroom to the North. A rat familiar scurries out (and Light is definitely at the point where they will believe that a rat can talk). As we pause to consider, a booming voice is heard in three directions, telling us to get out whilst we still can. Narthian moves towards the store room to investigate, and Bram cautions the rat to surrender (and, presumably by extension, the person whose familiar it is). We are told once again to leave...in the name of the Lords Alliance. The same group that Sildar belongs to and is meant to be maintaining order. Upon locating a wizard with red robes, dark red hair, a beard, and a glass staff, we conclude we have located Glass Staff, the leader (also because Randus kept mentioning we still had the boss fight to do and I guess didn't want us leaving without doing it). Diplomacy is somewhat attempted, but it is discovered that this member of the Lords Alliance has simply hired or taken over a bandit gang to 'enforce peace' and either encouraged or turned a blind eye to their other activities.

    Landan makes the first move, attempting to stick the traitor-to-the-cause with their (literally) shiny new dagger, and combat begins. Light takes out the familiar from horseback, and Faelar commences blade-singing. The exact same tune as Ella, the Elf who attacked us and whose actions contributed to Bezlik's death. Bram and Faelar close the gap and rediscover that flanking is a mechanic. With some damage now marked on the wizard, he misty steps to get out of the encirclement (and avoid so many attacks of opportunity). Glint misses her one shot before Narthian crits and pins the wizard to the wall...non-lethally.

    Landan is straight off to try and strip them and throw them in the chasm, but it talked down to instead handing him over to Sildar. Faelar recovers the glass staff, and finds that the Tiefling and Human from the supply closet fuckery are...no longer present. The blood is there, there are no undead around, but their bodies are gone. Our barricade is still in place so...and we set out back into town (picking up Faelar's owl familiar along the way). Arriving at the orchard we are greeted by Sildar, who confirms that The Glass Staff is indeed missing Lord Alliance member Iarno Albrek, who is stripped of his symbols of office (Also Narthian shows us her cool sorority pin).

    The prisoners are arranged -- the cell guard is looking for any excuse to not be celled with Iarno, but we don't give him a choice in the end. Adopt-a-Goblin day continues as Mirna Dendrar takes Droop back to the woodcutter's place, along with the three kids and Narthian. Faelar is more formally introduced as Faelar Starym from Evermeet blade-singer who claims not to bite people (but we're watching you!!) [Editor's note: there is no evidence that Ella was a dhampir, but Light doesn't really know that]. As the party deforms for the night, Faelar enters Sister Graelae's house, Landan stops by the provisioner to pick up some divination tools, and Light is transfer from Centaur to Bed.

    Glint gets a "night" time visitor in the form of Bailitheoir to hand over the 'Demon-Lovers Horn' (a gift given from tieflings/dragons as part of the nuptials dream sequence, having recently acquired a demon-lovers horn (from the tiefling/human pair in the manor). It is exchanged for a Staff of the Wild (magical quarterstaff) which is successfully caught and twirled. The next item on Glint's scavenger list is not yet known.

    Later Narthian encounters one of Thel's daughters crying over a package from Thel. Emotional moments and a shiny new magic bow that allows bypassing of some forms of cover and shielding.

  "Session Log – Session 18 (The Fading, 14th)": |
    The miner's exchange has a postal service (anywhere along the Swordcoast), which Faelar utilises to send word to Sister Garaele. The sentry owl doesn't report the slack black flying creature, but Faelar does notice it -- it continues flying North (so probably wasn't following Faelar).

    Over b̶r̶e̶a̶k̶f̶a̶s̶t̶ lunch the team reviews plans, discovered that the Black Spider put out a hit order on Inaro. (Question: was this with the drow? Where did we find this key?)

    We return to the manor and do some searching. Light stares into the Abyss, Glint just walks straight into it. The room with the missing corpses is still missing the corpses, but the armour and clothing are. We're uncertain what happened; there are two distinct areas of blood stains indicating the bodies moved, but there are no drag marks or footprints -- so it doesn't seem that they were either moved by hand or walked away.

    The sarcophagi were further checked, and only contained platinum signet rings. The prison room has a dozen sets of clothes, ranging from gnome or child, through to a 7 foot heavy set build. Amongst them is a set of travelling cloths that Light recognises from...somewhere.

    Suddenly: 30 feral beaver pelts (in the storeroom)

    We head to the room behind the secret doors. Glint rushes ahead, and Bram gets somewhat stuck in the corridor. We have

      - A chest with gold, gems, and two spell scrolls
      - A desk with papers including alchem stuff
      - A comfy bed

    The desk has a sealed/stamped/chopped note from the Black Spider "Lord Albrek, My spies in Neverwinter tell me that strangers are due to arrive in Phandalin. They could be working for the dwarves. Capture them if you can, kill them if you must, but don’t allow them to upset our plans. See that any dwarven maps in their possession are delivered to me with haste. I’m counting on you, Iarno. Don’t disappoint me."

    Looking closer at the two notes/orders that we have acquired...one is signed, one is stamped. One is a fake? It is likely that the stamped common written one is real, the one written in goblin was signed, and seemed to be . Inaro's orders were also stamped (with the Lords Alliance seal).

    The next room in is a alchemical lab with bookshelves -- all set up to mass produce invisibility potion. Amongst them is one book in dwarvish, and one log book of failed potion attempts with some interesting side effects (hair loss, blue bugbear fur, etc.). Landan takes the dwarvish book (Urmon's journal) to find information about the wave echo cave, including info on a magical mace 'Lightbringer' that would still be in the cave. Faelar gets some shiny ingredients.

    > a magic mace named Lightbringer was commissioned by priests of Lathander, the god of dawn, from the mages working with the gnomes and dwarves of the Phandelver’s Pact. It is unknown if the mace was completed or not, but what is known; is that if it was finished, the odds are good that it was still within the Wave Echo Cave the mine's location vanished from history.

    The alchemical room is sorted, labelled, and powered down. and we head out the forest exit and begin looking for tracks. Landan identifies some path markers, and we are able to track down where the half-drow acquired a horse (and cut the rest of the line loose). We do recover their carts, and now have cart transport!)

    Much lore and plot dump:
     - Inaro confirms that Black Spider is a Drow

     - Daran might be part of ~~an organisation~~
     - Old Owl Well area, lots of prospectors are prospecting but bring driven off by undead
     - Old Owl Well associated as an output of the Netheril empire
     - Netheril Empire might have left around lots of powerful magic

     - Probably other things my brain didn't process.
     - Droop is still in charge, and is settling in to be a woodcutter's assistant
     - Droop does not where Cragmaw Castle is. But knows who to ask -- the group that got .
     - Glint is going to be "super good"

  "Session Log – Session 19 (The Fading, 15th)": |
    "Light: The Void Blinked back"; "You see an infinite void expanding in all directions..."
     - There's a human (it's going to turn out to be Norman)
     - Light sort of works out movement, and tries to find an edge to the void.
     - Suddenly he is held, and gets crit-bitten for 18 points of damage
     - Beastial Light with two long bloody fangs
     - Fade to black
     - Wake; morning prayers!

    Faelar see the black flying thing around the inn as they leave in the morning, but it is gone by the time he comes back -- but he did send his owl out to look into it, but it hides as the owl approaches. What we do know: it is pure black, about a foot long, similar wingspan, small body.

    Faelar meets a praying Light at the shrine and notices how distracted Light, and gets invited to breakfast.
    Bram and Glint arrive downstairs at about the same time.
    Nilsa Dendrar is getting an impromptu job interview at the Inn, and then comes and delivers Landan's lore book to us. Landan was sleeping upstairs not half an hour ago. There's a sack of coins (100GP plus), and a crumbled note in. Looks like Landan has secrets and is being blackmailed (or bribes).
    The bird is a flying snake -> Zhentarim.

    Glint gets very angry at Landan for disappearing, ends up reading all of the notes all of the time. This includes a note for the woodcutter's daughter which got mixed in, and the note Light found upstairs.

    > Lots (over 3000) of dead owl bears at a site with a watch tower at a outpost. Possible Lich's phylactery, buried 5 miles deep.

    Light tries to solve every problem at the same time by splitting the party, getting the mining run sorted, looking for Landan, and updating Sildar and prepping the wagon.

    Suddenly a halfing bard, Merric (new player character?) from up North. Landan is "infamous up there" for being "the walking bomb". [Roll Play Thing will need to be resolved]

    At Adabra's windmill, we meet a Droop who is delivering some stuff from Mirna. We also buy all the potions, the two herbalism books, and find out the manticore spikes can be sold to Mirna

    On the route to the mine, we find 6 orc corpses, defrosting after being attacked by Cryovain (presumably). Oh, and Cryovain is at the mine, biting at the were-rats.
    Don Jon, the nuisance he is, wants them dead -- at 20GP per head

  "Session Log – Session 20 (The Fading, 15th--17th)": |
    - Talk to Don Jon. Expected staff: 7 dwarves, 2 teiflings, 2 goliaths, 4 humans, 2 half-elves.
    - Stash the cart
    - Approach the entrance
    - Negotiated Parley with the were-rat mine overseer
    - Light's bite has...no mark nor scar?
    - Insight Check: ...safe?
    - Guards (both female) seem to be on a short leash
    - We head in! (Narthian appears)
    - Cave system. many were-rats.
    - There is a regal were-rat, flanked by two human males
    - It's Glint Charisma Time!
    - From the shrine of Silvanus, just south of Connyberry
    - Thrown out by Orcs (possibly related to the other Orc issues)
    - They, uh, sacked the mines.
    - A shiny if offered to Glint; we were already leaning towards helping anyway
    - We *think* they will leave if we reclaim their old home.
    - They also claim they haven't turned anyway.
    - Don Jon is lead to the guest quarters
    - We were asked to leave by the back/shrine exit
    - We camp for the night, with watches. Faelar gets distracted.
    - Merric, on third watch, sees an extra set of non-humanoid prints that leads up to Light (oh no!)
    - Light doesn't really see anything in the tracks nor anything wrong with them, so it was clearly just some friendly critter. The Druid thing is really paying off!
    - We travel the Shrine of Savras, where Thena is rapidly shot down and Light experiments with deception.
    - Deception is...successful in that we can only see two orc so far. And one is down before initiative it resolved.
    - There are...so so many Orcs. Light attempts to escape by climbing the wall, and falls into the other side.
    - FIREBALL!
    - More combat

  "Session Log – Session 21 (The Fading, 17th)": |
    - Combat continues
    - Narthian crits
    - Merric goes down
    - Bram has sparkly armour (as in throws sparks) and magic breath
    - Glint catches 3 with sleep
    - Merric gets straight back up
    - And goes back down
    - Faelar's first crit
    - Light finally uses a reaction attack, and goes down to the next javelin
    - stuff happens.
    - Light nat 1s their final death save...and is transported back to the void-space
    - Where they try and become light
    - And instead pull in the darkness
    - Glint nearly gets one hit to death

  "Session Log – Session 22 (The Fading, 17th)": |
    - Light: not undead. But still having black eyes.
    - Rest time!
    - Ball of emptiness behind the eyes, like in the dreams.
    - The party rolls 3 different nat 20s on one perception check.
    - Mint has declared themselves the protector of Glint, possibly by channelled power from Glint's patron.
    - The party splits up and explores -- loot the bodies, check the perimeter, and Light decides to wonder in alone.
    - The shrine's temple room is covered in dust, and has four dead humanoids. The altar is on rollers and is clearly movable
    - Up top, Light's bolt is still around. And the ensaring strike vines are still there, decaying, in a worryingly natural way.
    - Light helps dispose of the final orc body! By falling off a tower
    - The rest of the team starts tidying up. Merric gives Faelar a potentially magically longbow
    - The priests get bundled up in blankets...it goes great until Bram and Glint touch the altar and go stiff
    - We try to move them away, and that goes great with Light also ending up touching it and paralysed.
    - flying high in the sky on massive white wings
    - below me are the ruins of a town being rebuilt (Leonin)
    - flying east -- trees, and field, ands trees, passing to Phandalian
    - flying further east come the base of a large mountain range, fly up to the peak, see a stone fortress
    - Light now knows the location of the dragon's nest!
    - Under the shrine was a box containing a magic key and some gold
    - We also find the solid gold bell, which was mentioned in Landan's journal but we had forgotten about.
    - We Tidy Up! (including dropping the bell down).

  "Session Log – Session 23 (The Fading, 18th)": |
    During our long rest a little way away from the Shrine, Bram gets a vision from Bahamut (presumed) showing Don Jon and the dwarves sealed off in a collapsed cave in a mine infested with were-rats, presumably the one that we had just come from. Bram, Glint, and Narthian leave to go off-screen scout back at the mine, leaving Light, Merric, and Faelar to continue on to Big Al's Butterskull Ranch (a most concerning name).

    As the party approached the the ranch, a couple of kilometers out the party finds a stray cow branded with BAK (Big Al Kalazorn). We attach a rope to her and begin taking her back to the ranch, keeping an eye out for other strays on the way.

    - Arriving at the ranch, we find...honestly a lovely map. I really like this.
    - As we approach with some mount of stealth using the Corn fields and orchards as cover, we find large numbers of loose pigs.
    - The barn, burnt, contains the remains of...some kind. Are they human, or are they dancer? But there's 7 of them.
    - We proceed towards the main house, to find a party going on. On the ground floor there are two drunk orcs, who were scouted by a Light who went invisible. They didn't realise that casting a spell broke that, and used druid craft to indicate the presence of hostiles
    - We flank around the building, and find the cellar storm door. We descend down to fine Al being worked over by an orc. We resume him with some amount of effectiveness!
    - The raid to clear the house begins. Light and Faelar catch on fire.
    - We pick up some Mithril Chain Mail, which is not of use to the party, but might be convertible to a chain shirt which is of use.

    - "The gnomes gave you a timeline. They will have finished the first step by next session"

  "Session Log – Session 24 (The Fading, 20th)": |
    The other half of the party went back to scout the were-rat-occupied mines. There are up to three entrances, only the front one is being actively patrolled. The plan is to, well, just go up to the front door again and tell them the shrine is clear of orcs. We have no concrete evidence that they are going to betray our trust, despite the warnings from Bahamut.

    I am very suspicious of everything the DM is doing today.

    We head inside and attempt to have the situation resolved with Diplomacy. A rat is sent to get our reward, a rat is sent to confirm our claims by verifying the bell, and neither of them are being sento gather up the rats to kill us at all. As far as Light can tell, everything is going great, but Glint and Mint notice something is up. As Glint tries to cast silent image to distract a flanking party, their spell-casting is noticed by the were-rat.
    That were-rat attempts to stop the spell casting by biting Glint, triggering combat.

    First round of combat sees Light discover that these things don't take damage from bludgeoning and slashing damage, and isn't that maneuverable because they are the light source and are in a corridor. Bram scares a lot of them with a godly roar, and the mages bring out thunder and fire. Despite this the combat goes...slowly, grindingly.

    The leader, carrying a magic item Kitteh would really like to get their paws on, starts to both run away (tracked via Glint's mind spike) and summons a pack of rodents of unusual size. As the party shuffles around and more into the main room, Light ducks in and closes the door behind them...leading to the second destroyed door of the campaign.

    The rats are eventually defeated, no-one in the party went down, but multiple people contracted lycanthropy. Fun.

  "Session Log – Session 25 (The Fading, 20th)": |
    We give chase to the rat queen Zelene...the connection drops after a few seconds after as she...runs into a dead end with traps and Duergar with a magic bow and a big illustrious beard. (Sorry Randus, you gave a longer description but I wasn't typing at the time.
    Light's current chain of thought is "this is a closed room, but they're armed, and they weren't locked in, but they had a trap and killed Zelene???".
    Ah, they knows misty step. That begins to explain some things. Also they disappear whenever they leave the light cone, even to night vision. Most curious.

    Their armour is also spiked and damages people in melee range...and it has a giant tentacle-y friend.

    The bow is meant to be something that I remember. Anyway, once he gets disrupted, the bow seems to have illuminated him. Oh, and it's made of glass.
    The tentacle monster goes down quickly, Kitteh iterates through a number of dinner plans they don't actually feel like doing and gets mid-way through frying some veg before wheeling to a sandwich, and the dwarf attempts to make a fighting retreat. They are felled and...captured. Sadly the spikes on his armour make him very hard to stabilised, and he dies...and the body disappears. The armour and gear are still there, but like the Human and Tiefling in the Red Band base, the ones with the glass dagger.

    We take a short rest wherein Glint shows us the gold ore she found (and doesn't mention the magic item she picked up off of Zelene). As we begin reexamining the rest of the mine, we find such exciting things as:
      - A half decomposed corpse.
      - 10 fresh mounds of dirt, which are likely graves.
      - A pen full of just large rats
      - A door with moaning behind it

    Merric has thieves tools, that's exciting. Sadly he doesn't seem to be able to open this lock. We break out the full toolkit to see if we can open it without damaging the people behind, and...that doesn't go brilliantly. But we manage to get in, and find the remaining staff and Don Jon. We give them some water and food.

    The party continues exploring whilst Bram, Glint, and Narthian get the ex-prisoners onto the cart. We find some wheelbarrows, a big store of food and water, the general supplies you would expect in a mine. The cot rooms are very low quality -- barracks without lockers or chests, just a row of cots.

    From the outside we are able to find our way into their rec-room, which actually looks likes kind of nice. I mean, these people life here 24/7 so it's not good enough, but it's something.

    The remaining tasks we have are to stop the bodies miasmaing up the mine, and sorting out the pen of not-were rats. As ever, the party has entirely sensible plans for how to do this, resulting in us discovering one of the rats is in fact another were-rat. The group on burial duty takes care of them whilst Light performs a majestic leap leading the rat-rats out of the cave.

    Overall haul from the cave: 10 lumps of gold, so resellable weapons, a couple of potions, dwarven spiked mail, a glass bow, a ring of keys, 5 starving dwarves, a Don Jon, and some loose gold.

  "Session Log – Session 26 (The Fading, 21st/22nd/23rd)": >
    The were-rat-ening commences:
      - Faelar: brand-new fangs
      - Merric: bigger fluffier ears
      - Light: rat nose with extra whiskers 
    
    Glint is the one to notice, and encourages us to all look at our reflections (and also plucks one of Light's new whiskers).
    
    We work out pretty quickly that we're probably were-rats. An attempt is made to identify the potions, but it fails.
    
    We return to town; Narthian leaves us at the woodworkers, now relabelled as the "Herbalism Shop", as we proceed to Alderleaf Farm.
    And this time we don't even traumatise any kids (Nars from down the road is actually over playing with Carp!).
    
    Asides: Glint appears to staring at random things. I wonder what that is about.
    
    The overall status of is: in need of much sleep and food. Bram and Glint take them off to the inn whilst the rest of
    us get checked over ourselves by Qelline. She examines the bite marks, especially Merric's with the extra tattooing.
    She recommended not letting people know lest they become hostile, and also notes that Mirna is the best person in
    town to ask -- her parents are rumoured to have worked on a similar condition, but depending on
    the version of the story either succeeded 
    
    As Bram and Glint return, Glint returns with magic items --
    [a key that can open any lock](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:mystery-key),
    [a pair of goggles that allow night vision](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:goggles-of-night),
    and a [silver needle that allows someone to project their melee attacks](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/wondrous-items:eldritch-claw-tattoo).
    
    Bram has also stopped by the smithy to ask about the spiked
    horse shoes, and was trying to be up-sold a battle scythe.
    The shoes will be ready in about a ten-day (so top of the next month). 
    
    The options for the gold bell are discussed -- the consensus is that trying to sell it outright
    in town is a _bad_ idea, but smelting it down here would likely be an advantage.
    Otherwise we need to transport it to somewhere like Neverwinter.
    
    We proceed to the town master's hall in order to hand in the transportation of Don Jon,
    the quest board has been updated. We hand in the butter skull and the writ from Don Jon.
    200gp get, added to party funds. The town master is also seeming a lot more confident,
    and much more...in charge?
    
    We head north in the town, with Faelar heading to the provisioners, where he learns that
    none of the spell components he wants are available, and Barthen isn't an actual full
    on Wizard. The bow is identified at the standard price of 10gp, and it's a nice magic
    glass short bow.
    
    At the smithy we find that he doesn't deal with armour that much, especially mithril;
    instead it is recommended that we go the Lionshield Coster for that.
    The matter of the gold bell is raised -- we consider having it melted down into ingots,
    but it turns out in the end that we can just get it melted down for cash right now
    to keep things simple.

    The providence of the bell gets slightly raised, but it turns out the smith has heard
    the story town that melted down their gold to hide it from the orcs.
    "if it was me, I would have given the orcs the gold and try to run" he says;
    "the orcs we have encountered haven't been the most reasonable", Merric replies.
    
    We settle on a deal for 2500gp for the bell to be melted down by the smithy,
    which works out to about a 10% handling fee, which isn't too bad.
    
    As we re-cross town, we see a small white dragonborn girl (child) heading into the inn.
    A new visitor to the town, who is very young -- she's still smaller than Merric.
    
    As the Coster, we see Linene and the end of the silvering deal (we kind of missed
    the boat on that). She is very excited (and suddenly not "just closing up the shop")
    when she hears we are looking to sell some mithril chain mail.
    Problems occur when we are asked for price -- Light has no idea, nor does anyone
    else in the party.
    Faelar has an interesting moment of failed negotiations -- I'm not actually sure
    if she thinks we're low balling or high balling her. We settle in the end to sell
    if for 375gp.

    A smaller sub-party goes into the miner's exchange -- fewer were rats to be seen.
    Inside Merric is introduced to the wonderful of selling ores. We get 100gp
    (in the form of 10 platinum). Merric takes a moment to look around and see if
    there's anyone or anything shady going on.

    As we return the the freshly minted herbalist Mirna, we spot Narthian heading
    out of town. We knock on the door, and get invited in as Mirna notices that
    something is wrong. Nars is sent up to bed as we fill in Mirna. Glint realises
    for the first time that we might be infectious, and gets slightly agitated.
    Bram takes her to catch up with Droop.
    
    Mirna reports that she just about remembers her parents attempting to cure
    lycanthropy, it appearing to work, but the patient croaking the next morning.
    Also something about "drinking being better than sleeping" -- hopefully not blood.
    
    Droop is still in charge.
    
    As we head back toward the inn, Faelar peels off to return to Sister Garaele's
    home, wherein he finds a brown paper package tied up with string, and a note
    that...was not read out. But Faelar opens it up and finds inside the box
    a jewelled comb, a map from the ruins of Conyberry to a location a short
    distance into the Neverwinter Wood, and a smaller box with five sheets
    of paper with margin notes, which are some kind of magical item.

    In the inn, Milsa is running taking orders, but immediately aims us to a
    table without neighbours. The little dragonborn girl and an older white
    dragon-born who is packing up a lead box in a closet.
    We move to the designated table.
    
    Little dragon born is called Mary -- were at Falcon's Hunting Lodge.
    Left because of a dragon attack, eating one of the guards. Information
    is from the little girl, so may not be the most accurate.
    The parent is called "The Lady of Frost" by Milsa, and is known by
    Merric to be a travelling merchant of sorts. She's going to be running
    a shop out of inn. Her daughter is adorable.
    
    There was an old drunk tiefling, talking about goblin raids on the
    Triboar trail -- probably out of Cragmaw Castle.
    
    We have food, we relax, and we turn in for the night.

    Morning routines are pretty standard -- Light is praying for guidance,
    understanding, and health; Merric writes a letter home; breakfast is
    consumed. The dragonborn shop opens up and Faelar discovers is she
    sells scrolls, finally...still not allowing him to acquire identify
    as she doesn't have it stock.
    
    As we head down to Mirna's, we see Droop heading off toward Adabra's
    (probably where Narthian is as well). She invites us in, where we find
    a number of services and very convenient piles like "everything you need
    to cast find familiar". A lot of the services seem to be anything that
    might be able to bring in a few coins.
    
    The notes were located, and written up for us. We are asked to record
    how it goes and bring all the information back to Mirna, which we
    agree to do.

    - Blood, our own, that's easy
    - Nightshade -- if we can collect 10gp, we can have the rest all grown in 3--4 days.
      Faelar has 25gp of powered night shade.
    - Rare Oils and Unguents -- we can get 25% off from Mirna.
    - 100gp of wolfsbane...we need somewhere dark and bloody...
    - Divine Blessing -- Bram was blessed by being touching the shrine,
      but only for 12 hours after the first touch. That's 2 definitely sorted. 

    We finally trade off the manticore spikes and find out that the vials, which
    are identified as being carrion crawler mucus, a very dangerous poison.
    Sold the spikes for 60gp, acquired 3 health potions for 150gp.

  "Session Log – Session 27 (The Fading, 23rd/24th)": >
    Everything was Fine. Kitteh was not present for the session, so these notes are second hand.
    
    Merric now has access to the sending spell, and is intending to use it to
    find and recover Landan. We can get "his magical essence" from his book.
    The message is composed by Light (but why? why would you pick Light?)
    and is successfully sent on the second attempt -- and a response is received
    
    > Light, I was ambushed. Restrained somewhere damp, dark.
    > Goblins or kobolds run by Giz, an orc.
    > They seem more interested in people than that weapon.

    Neither Silidar nor Daran know of Giz, so we're not 100% on where to go
    next for getting Landan back. Light also asked if anyone had been back into
    the Red Bands hideout, and then headed down there to go look for ingredients
    for the cure.

    Back on the main plan, the party sets out to...get ambushed? (ok, this is
    Kitteh's plan, I shouldn't sound shocked). We are on the hunt for a number
    of unknown locations -- Landan's and Cragmaw Castle specifically.
    Glint uses Silent Image to give the impression that Bram is actually just
    a horse pulling the cart. The rest of the party looks a lot less deadly,
    with limited armour. Faelar, with the noble background is set up as the mark,
    and Merric is placed on the flank, with Thena flying as an AWAC OWL.
    
    The carriage party heads off; the first day of travel and the overnight stay
    at the junction of the Triboar Trial with the Phandalin spur is uneventful.
    The second day heading west events start with another party heading east
    along the trail towards us -- three horses and riders, of unknown disposition
    are seen by Thena. At short distance from us, the horse falls under one of
    the riders who screams as they tumble to the ground. They get ambushed very
    shortly before the parties meet -- which either indicates a brave set of
    ambushers taking two groups at once, a group of attackers who are unaware
    we are coming, or Randus just really wanting to make sure we get to talk to one
    of these people alive.
    The location of the ambush is exactly where Silidar was ambushed.
    
    The attackers are a group of goblins! The two on the road are within Fire Bolt
    range, but seem to be a bit tougher than the average goblin commoner you'll
    see on the street. They take cover behind the downed horses.
    There's also two or more hanging around the outside of the path -- two sets
    of arrows come out for Glint from the south, and at least one person relocates
    to the north side of the road.

    Faelar hastes Bram, who charges in. Glint uses Create Bonfire to mark one
    goblin for the rest of the party to target (and to, you know, start fires).
    Merric casts Hypnotic pattern on on that area, catching the two central goblins
    (by the power of glow sticks).
    
    An lean (and mean?) looking Orc attempts to hit and run Bram, and discovered
    that Bram has an Orc-slaying sword.
    Glint goes down, but is quickly picked up by Cure Wounds.
    Bram discovers that one of the travellers is still alive under her horse.
    Glint gets to play around with Blink, which is a really cool spell that
    hides you off in the Ethereal Plane between rounds, essentially.

    The bonfire Goblin is booming bladed -- meaning bonus damage if it leaves
    the bonfire, or for remaining in the fire. It goes down within the next
    couple of rounds in the end to a bow shot from Merric.
    Meanwhile, back in the road, the Orc reappears to cast darkness over the
    areas with Bram, the traveller, and themselves.
    
    The North-side Goblins include a stealthy friend who manages to keep re-hiding
    right up until the moment that Merric stumbles into it. The goblins are taken
    out by the rest of the party outside of the darkness.

    Back inside the darkness, Bram is in a problematic situation -- the civilian
    is down on the ground, and the orc is still in there somewhere (presumably).
    Bram gently finds the civilian with a hoof, lays on hoof, and invites them
    up onto his back. The fight in the darkness goes slowly in when measured
    in attacks, but between everyone in there attacks were coming one a second,
    with a lot of missing.
    Glint, in a bit of a panic, attempts to cast sleep into the darkness;
    the only person who goes down is the civilian on Bram's back, who starts
    falling off. Both sides land heavy blows, leaving the Bram at 1, and the
    Orc still reasonably up. As things draw to a head Faelar rushes in (as
    all known goblins are down) but the final blow is successfully struck by
    Bram.

    Battle Summary: Stressful but Satisfying.

    Two goblins are available for questioning, held by the cousins of rope-chan.
    One rescued fair maiden, who has lost two travelling companions.
    Glint noticed a rustling up to the North which could totally be Light. Totally.
    Definitely not more Goblins. Or Orcs. Or anything of that nature.
