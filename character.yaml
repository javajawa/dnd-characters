  - name: Darkvision
    source: Tabaxi racial feature
    description: >-
      You have a cat's keen senses, especially in the dark.
      You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light,
      and in darkness as if it were dim light.
      You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
  - name: Feline Agility
    source: Tabaxi racial feature
    description: >-
      Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed.
      When you move on your tum in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn.
      Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.
  - name: Cat's Claws
    source: Tabaxi racial feature
    description: >-
      Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet.
      In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.
      If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier,
      instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
  - name: Shelter of the Faithful
    source: Acolyte background feature
    description: >-
      As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith,
      and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity.
      You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing
      and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith,
      though you must provide any material components needed for spells.
      Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.
      You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen
      deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there.
      This could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good
      terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home.
      While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance,
      provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain
      in good standing with your temple.
  - name: Unarmored Defense
    source: Monk class feature
    description: >-
      Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield,
      your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.
  - name: Martial Arts
    source: Monk class feature
    description: >-
      At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of
      combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons,
      which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don't have
      the two-handed or heavy property.
      You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding
      only monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:
      You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage
      rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
      You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike
      or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown
      in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table. When you use the Attack
      action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can
      make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the
      Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an
      unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a
      bonus action this turn.

backstory:
  "Traits - Sheltered": >-
    I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical
    experience dealing with people in the outside world.
  "Traits - Isolated": >-
    I grew up in a church-as-a-family, with many who loved me,
    but none who were particular close and nuturing.
  "Ideals - Charity": >-
    I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost.
  "Flaws - Piety": >-
    My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.
  "Flaws - Pascifism": >-
    I will not harm a being, unless it is causing harm to me or those around me.
    Even then, I will try to disable rather than kill or destroy
  "God - Eldath": >-
    Eldath was a pacifist who avoided hostile action, even if threatened.
    Although shy, quiet, and enigmatic, the Green Goddess was possessed of
    unknown depths of character and unexpressed resolve that could not be broken.
    Eldath protected rivers, streams, and druids' groves.
  "Bonds - [todo]": >-
    [i need to invent the monetary master and abbess]
  "Backstory": |
    Light was left as a orphan at a abbey of Eldath near the confluence of the Surbrin and Dessarin rivers (near Yartar). Named "Light Eldath"(?rework) for the element of the Goddess, they were later given a more traditional Tabaxi name of "Light in the Morning".
    They were raised into the faith and ways of Eldath, as a helper and a pacifist but never touched by the god. Around the Abbey, they helped out with services, chores, and turned out to be a passable cook. They were raised as a vegetarian and a pacifist.
    As they became of age, they helped escorted the travellers, including the supply merchants from Yartar to the abbey, and learnt the basis of how to defend themselves with staff and claw.
    During one trip to Yartar, they were invited to join a group of monks in their Monestry, where they learnt how to actually truly use the weapons and the concept of Ki. On completing their training, on their first mission of intervention, they saw monks using their powers for offence for the first time, and turned away from the monestry and the leader.
    Considering themselves estranged from both Church and Monestary, they headed west to, paying their way via chores and cooking, until they found themself in [GM will hook us up here]
