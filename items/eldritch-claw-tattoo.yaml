description: |-
  Produced by a special needle, this magic tattoo depicts claw-like forms and other jagged shapes.

  Tattoo Attunement. To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin
  where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process.
  When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes
  the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

  If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes,
  and the needle reappears in your space.
