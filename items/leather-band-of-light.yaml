description: |-
  An old leather band, it surprisingly conforms to any part of your body that you chose to wrap it around.
  Given to you by an elderly half-elf monk that has long since retired from
  adventuring and taking up residence as the head of security of the holy site
  in which you were raised.
  
  She gave this to you on the day you set out to join the monastery,
  saying "may this simple band of leather always reflect your Inner Light in
  both the brightest and darkest of times",
  at which point is started to glow as if by magic.
