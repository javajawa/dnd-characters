      Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects within range:

       - You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.
       - You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom.
       - You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
       - You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.

      Concentration, up to 1 minute

      The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends,
      a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact,
      and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained
      by the magical vines until the spell ends.
      A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw.
      If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

      While restrained by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage
      at the start of each of its turns. A creature restrained by the vines
      or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a
      Strength check against your spell save DC.
      On a success, the target is freed.

    description:
      The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns.
      The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration.
      When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
      
      The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural.
      Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast
      must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to
      recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
